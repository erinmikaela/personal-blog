					<h2>Atomic Habits</h2>
					<p>by: James Clear</p>
					<p>
						I recently finished reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, and I can
						honestly say it's one of the most practical and motivating books
						I've come across in a long time. I picked it up because I wanted to
						make some positive changes in my life but often found myself
						struggling to stick with new habits. Clear's method struck a chord
						with me right away since it was refreshingly simple and practical.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since reading Atomic Habits, I've been experimenting with a few new
						habits, using the Four Laws to guide me. For example, I've started a
						habit of journaling every night. I made it obvious by keeping my
						journal next to my bed, I made it easy by setting a goal to write
						just one sentence if I'm tired, and I made it satisfying by marking
						each day off in a calendar when I complete it. After a few weeks, it
						feels more natural, and I'm already noticing the benefits.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyone who is serious about creating long-lasting changes in their
						lives, regardless of how big or little should read Atomic Habits, in
						my opinion. The lessons I've learned from this book are things I can
						see myself using for years to come.

					<h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2>
					<p>by: Arthur Conan Doyle</p>
					<p>
						The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was one of my favorite reads of
						all time. This book is the first collection of short stories Arthur
						Conan Doyle wrote about Sherlock Holmes. Each work narrates the
						various cases that the detective works on, accompanied by his former
						roommate and colleague Dr. John Watson, who narrates the tales.
					</p>
					<p>
						While I enjoyed all twelve stories, a few really stood out for me. A
						Scandal in Bohemia, the first story, introduces Irene Adler, one of
						the few people who truly challenges Holmes. I loved the twist and
						the respect Holmes has for her by the end. The Red-Headed League was
						another favorite. It's such a bizarre case on the surface, but
						Holmes' solution is ingenious and unexpected. And then there's The
						Adventure of the Speckled Band, it was definitely eerie and
						suspenseful that I couldn't put it down until I found out the
						ending. Each story had something unique to offer, but these three
						kept me hooked the most.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a classic for a reason. The
						storytelling, the intriguing mysteries, and the dynamic between
						Holmes and Watson make it a truly enjoyable read. It's the kind of
						book that kept me guessing and trying to solve the cases alongside
						Holmes, even though I rarely figured it out before he did. If you're
						a fan of mysteries or just want to experience the iconic detective
						in action, I highly recommend this book. There's a reason Sherlock
						Holmes series is still pretty popular in the genre, as his
						adventures are as captivating now as they were when they were first
						published.

					<h2>-Rooted-</h2>

					<p>
						A rose's beauty is admired afar <br />
						Anyone who touches gets nothing but scar; <br />
						Thorned between her own abomination <br />
						Love and warmth were shown <br />
						Still, it found rest in isolation <br />
						For she knows she cannot <br />
						hurt no heart than her own <br />

					<h2>-Trust fall-</h2>

					<p>
						She jumped into <br />
						his shallow heart <br />
						Knowing she <br />

						falling in a trap of lies<br />
						and hit the rock bottom hard<br />

					<h2>-Hush-</h2>

						Darkness enclosed the place <br />

						Thud comes after <br />

						Hush now, no one <br />

					<h2>-Lie-</h2>

					<p>
						While there hands intertwined <br />
						"I love you!", she said as she smiles <br />
						He just stood there as he cry <br />
						Because he knew, it was a lie <br /><br/>

						Fake feelings, false promises, unreal love <br />
						She made him feel that he's dearly loved <br />
						Oh boy, who would knew he's such a fool  <br />
						For being blinded by the obvious truth <br /><br/>

						He keeps weeping until he spoke <br />
                        "Is that all? Do you have anye more lies to say?"<br/>
